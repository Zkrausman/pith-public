## [2.3.2] - 2026-08-18
### Added
- **Antigravity Model Attribution:** `hook-pretool` now extracts `modelName` from the Antigravity hook payload and forwards `--model` to the Pith runner.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-08-18
### Fixed
- **Telemetry Harness Normalization:** Added `antigravity` canonical harness mapping to `normalizeHarness` so stats and gains are properly categorized under the `antigravity` harness breakdown.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-18
### Added
- **Antigravity 2.0 & Antigravity CLI Integration:** Added `hook-pretool` subcommand implementing Antigravity's `PreToolUse` lifecycle hook specification to intercept and compress `run_command` output while preserving daemon and self-invocation guards.
- **Automated Antigravity Hook Installation:** Added `pith install --antigravity` to configure `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` or `.agents/hooks.json` non-destructively.
- **PowerShell Runner Resilience:** Enhanced Windows runner execution to support PowerShell/pwsh statement chaining (`;`), cmdlets, and environment variable expansion.
- **Source Attribution:** Telemetry and gain reporting now tracks executions and token savings under the `antigravity` source.
